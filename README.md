# Welcome to the Triumph Web App Stack

This stack is based off of the following stack:

# MySQL
https://www.mysql.com/

# C# Entity Framework
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ef/getting-started

# ASP.NET Core 2.0
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=macos

# React.js
https://reactjs.org/


# Why I picked this stack:
C# has been around for quite some time now, with quite a few tutorials and quite a bit of documentation found all across the
web. This is why I chose to go with C#. 

React.js is super lightweight, and built on JavaScript. It has a huge following already, which makes it easy to get help when need


# Business Service:
The business service is where I hold the access to the data, basic exceptions,helpers for the controllers, the models of the data, and the overall business services of the data models.

# WebAPI:
This project is strictly to hold the controller APIs and more indepth helpers.

# WebClient:
This project is where the beautiful React.js is used for the UI. I love React, it is very modular, and very useful in the case of said modular components. If you know JavaScript and HTML, you know React and it's glory.
